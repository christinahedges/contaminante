This target was observed during the prime *Kepler* mission, and was flagged as a planet candidate. In fact, the target has a contaminating eclipsing binary. This binary is only obvious in some of the *Kepler* quarters. \n",

In the case that the contaminator light curve is **shallower** than the target light curve, it is likely that some faint pixels have been missed from the optimum aperture. This does not indicate that there is any contamination.\n",
