Because faint pixels can contribute a transiting signal at a lower, less significant level, some faint pixels can be missed in contaminante. In the case that the contaminator light curve is **shallower** than the target light curve, it is likely that some faint pixels have been missed from the optimum aperture. This does not indicate that there is any contamination.\n",
